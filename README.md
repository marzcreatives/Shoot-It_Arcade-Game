This is an arcade shooting game made in python suing pygame.
All assets are within the folder, including the different types of ducks, cups and balloons.

The game comes with three different playing modes: freeplay, accuracy and countdown. 

Freeplay mode is a point based game, where you shoot all the targets within as little time as you can.

Accuracy mode comes with a limited number of pellets to shoot with and ends once those are over.

Countdown mode gives you a time constraint to get as many targets as you can.
